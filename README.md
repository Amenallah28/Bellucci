# Bellucci

Bellucci is a fashion discovery mobile app, where users swipe through clothing items like Tinder. They can like, dislike, or mark items to purchase. The app uses filters and later AI to recommend clothing based on user preferences and events. Clothing items are either fetched from APIâ€™s or scraped from online stores or uploaded by small businesses and resellers.
